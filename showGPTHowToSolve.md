<!--- I would like to show ChatGPT how to solve one of these puzzles: 


9, 2, 8, 5 one number is correct but wrong placed
 1, 9, 3, 7 two numbers are correct but wrong placed
 5, 2, 0, 1 one number is correct and well placed
 6, 5, 0, 7 nothing is correct
 8, 5, 2, 4 two numbers are correct but wrong placed
s-->

Prompt: An example of a puzzle is


    9, 2, 8, 5 one number is correct but wrong placed
    1, 9, 3, 7 two numbers are correct but wrong placed
    5, 2, 0, 1 one number is correct and well placed
    6, 5, 0, 7 nothing is correct
    8, 5, 2, 4 two numbers are correct but wrong placed

1. First, I would check if there is a nothing is correct. If there is, I would eliminate all the numbers in the puzzle from the possible numbers. in this case, there is a nothing is correct, so I would eliminate all the numbers in the puzzle from the possible numbers.
    1. eliminate all 6 
    
    9, 2, 8, 5 one number is correct but wrong placed
    1, 9, 3, 7 two numbers are correct but wrong placed
    5, 2, 0, 1 one number is correct and well placed
    ~~6~~, 5, 0, 7 nothing is correct
    8, 5, 2, 4 two numbers are correct but wrong placed

    2. eliminate all 5
